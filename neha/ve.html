Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga temple, also known as Vaidyanath dham is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the most sacred abodes of Shiva. The location of Vaidyanath
 Jyotirlinga in Deoghar, Jharkhand.
In Dwadasa jyothirlinga sthothram, Adi Sankaracharya has praised Vaidyanath jyothirlinga 
<p>
This states that Vaidyanath jyotirlinga is located at
 Prajwalika nidhanam (meaning funeral place i.e., chithabhoomi) in the North-Eastern part of the country. 
Located Parli which is in central part of the country. Also Chidabhoomi indicates 
that, in olden days, this was a funeral place, where corpses are burnt and post-death
 ceremonies were performed. This place could have been a centre of tantric cults like Kapalika/Bhairava where 
Lord Shiva is worshipped significantly as smasan vasin (meaning, residing in crematorium), 
sava bhasma bhushita (meaning, smearing body with ashes of burnt bodies).

Legend has it that Ravana meditated upon Shiva, and requested him to come over to Sri Lanka, 
in order that his capital may become invincible. It is said that he attempted to lift Mount Kailash and take it with him to his capital;
 however Shiva crushed him with his finger, and Ravana prayed to him and sought his
 mercy, after which Shiva gave him one of the twelve Jyotirlingams with the condition that if it was placed on the ground it would take root immediately.
<p>Ravana carried the Jyotirlingam and began his trek back to his capital. Varuna the God of water, entered his belly, and caused
 him to feel the need to relieve himself. 
Vishnu then came down in the form of a lad and volunteered to hold the Jyotirlingam as he relieved 
himself. Before Ravana returned, Vishnu placed the Jyotirlingam on the ground, and it became rooted 
to the spot. A disappointed Ravana offered severe penances to Shiva here, and cut off nine of 
his heads. Shiva revived him and joined the heads to the body, as if by the work of a Vaidya or a physician, hence this
 Jyotirlingam goes by the name Vaidyanath. The same legend holds at Gokarnam in Karnataka.
Another legend has it that this temple was re-discovered by a cowherd Baiju, and hence the name Baijnath.</p>

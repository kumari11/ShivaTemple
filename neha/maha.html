The idol of Omkareshwar Mahadev is consecrated in the sanctum above the Mahakal shrine. 
The images of Ganesh, Parvati and Karttikeya are installed in the west, north and east of the sanctum sanctorum. 
To the south is the image of Nandi, the vehicle of Lord Shiva. 
The idol of Nagchandreshwar on the third storey is open for darshan only on the day of Nag Panchami. 
The temple has five levels, one of which is underground. 
The temple itself is located in a spacious courtyard surrounded by massive walls near a lake. 
The shikhar or the spire is adorned with sculptural finery. 
Brass lamps light the way to the underground sanctum. 
It is believed that prasada (holy offering) offered here to the deity can be re-offered unlike all other shrines
On the day of Maha Shivaratri, a huge fair is held near the temple, and worship goes on through the night.<center>

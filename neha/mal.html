Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deities Shiva and Parvati, located at Srisailam in Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. 
It is significant to the Hindu sects of both Shaivam and Shaktam as this temple is referred to as one of the twelve Jyothirlingas of Lord Shiva and as one of the eighhteen Shakti Peethas of goddess Parvati. 
Shiva is worshiped as Mallikarjuna, and is represented by the lingam. 
His consort Parvati is depicted as Brahmaramba. 
It is the only temple in India which is revered as both Jyotirlinga and Shaktipeeth.
<p>When Shiva and Parvati decided to find suitable brides for their sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya argued as to who is to get wedded first. 
Shiva bade that the one who goes round the world in Pradakshinam could get married first. 
By the time Kartikeya could go round the world on his vahana, Ganesha went round his parents 7 times (for according to Shastras, going in pradakshinam round one's parents is equivalent to going once round the world (Bhupradakshinam). 
Siva got Buddhi(intellect), Siddhi (spiritual power), and Riddhi (prosperity) married to Ganesha. 
kartikeya on his return was enraged and went away to stay alone on Mount Kraunja in the name of Kumarabrahmachari. 
On seeing his father coming over to pacify him, he tried to move to another place, but on the request of the Devas, stayed close by. 
The place where Siva and Parvati stayed came to be known as Shrishailam.

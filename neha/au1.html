 Aundha Nagnath (Nageshwaram) is supposed to be the eighth of the twelve jyotirlingas in India, an important place of pilgrimage.
The present temple is said to have been built by the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty and dates to 13th century. The first temple is said to be from time of
 the Mahabharata and is believed to have been constructed by Yudhishthira, eldest of the Pandavas, when they were expelled for 14 years from Hastinapur.
It has been stated that this temple building was of seven-storyed before it was sacked by Aurangzeb.
Today, however, the Sanctum Sanctorum, which is located below the ground level accessed by two deep steps is with The narrow chamber offers little space for the
 devotees to worship, added to which constant prayers
 (Abhisheka) by Chants of Pandits allow peace of mind for offering ones personal prayers.
<p>There is one famous story told about Namdev and Aundha Nagnath temple. Once when he was chanting Bhajans in front of the temple with his senior gurus, Visoba Khechara and few more Varkari, the temple pujari told them their singing in front of the temple is disturbing their routine pooja and prayers and asked them to go away from temple. The temple pujari told Bhagat Namdev, insulted him and said he is of lower caste and why he has come to the temple. Then Bhagat Namdev went back side of the temple and started singing bhajans there. But God, in order to be in the sight of the pining devotee and listen bhajans, revolved the temple. 
It is testimonial to that miracle why Nandi is located on back side of temple</p>

Grishneshwar temple, sometimes referred to as the Ghrneshwar Jyotirlinga or Dhushmeshwar temple, is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga shrines mentioned in the Shiva 
Purana.The word Ghrneshwar means "lord of compassion".The temple is an important 
pilgrimage site in Shaivism tradition of Hinduism, which considers it as the last or twelfth Jyotirlinga 
(linga of light).This pilgrimage site is located in Ellora (also called Verul), less than a 
kilometer from Ellora Caves – a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 30 kilometres (19 miles) north-west of
 the city of Aurangabad, and about 300 kilometres (190 miles) east-northeast from Mumbai.
<p>This temple was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate during the Hindu-Muslim wars of 13th and 14th-century. The temple went through several 
rounds of rebuilding followed by re-destruction during the Mughal-Maratha conflict. It was rebuilt in the current
 form in the 18th century under the sponsorship of a Hindu queen Rani Ahalyabai of Indore, after the fall of the 
Mughal Empire.It is presently an important and active pilgrimage site of the Hindus and attracts long lines of devotees 
daily. Anyone can enter the temple premises and its inner chambers, but to enter the sanctum sanctorum core 
(garbha-ghrya) of the temple, the local Hindu tradition demands that men must go bare chested.</p>
The Grishneswar temple is an illustration of south Indian temple architectural style and structure. The temple, 
built of red rocks, is composed of a five tier shikara. The temple was re-constructed by Maloji Bhosale of 
Verul, (grandfather of Shivaji) in the 16th century and later again by queen Ahilyabai Holkar in the 18th century. 
She is credited with rebuilding some of major Hindu temples such as the Kashi Vishvanath temple 
in Varanasi, a Vishnu temple in Gaya, and a much larger Shiva Jyotirlinga temple in Somnath.

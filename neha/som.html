The Somnath temple located in Prabhas Patan near Veraval in Saurashtra on the western coast of Gujarat, is believed to be the first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.
It is an important pilgrimage and tourist spot of Gujarat. 
Destroyed and reconstructed several times in the past by several Muslim invaders and Portuguese,the present temple was reconstructed in Chaulukya style of Hindu temple architecture and completed in May 1951.
The reconstruction was envisioned by Vallabhbhai Patel and was completed under K. M. Munshi, the then head of the temple trust.
<p>According to tradition, the Shivalinga in Somnath is one of the twelve jyotirlingas in India, where Shiva is believed to have appeared as a fiery column of light. The jyotirlingas are taken as the supreme, undivided reality out of which Shiva partly appears.
Each of the twelve jyotirlinga sites take the name of a different manifestation of Shiva.At all these sites, the primary image is a lingam representing the beginning-less and endless stambha (pillar), symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.In addition to the one at Somnath, the others are at Varanasi, Rameswaram, Dwarka, etc.

<u><h2>History ::</h2></u>
According to popular tradition documented by J. Gordon Melton, the first Siva temple at Somanath is believed to have been built at some unknown time in the past. 
The second temple is said to have been built at the same site by the "Yadava kings" of Vallabhi around 649 CE. In 725 CE, Al-Junayd, the Arab governor of Sindh is said to have destroyed the second temple as part of his invasions of Gujarat and Rajasthan.
The Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II is said to have constructed the third temple in 815 CE, a large structure of red sandstone.<p>
However, there is no historical record of an attack on Somnath by Al-Junayd. Nagabhata II is known to have visited tirthas in Saurashtra, including Someshvara (the Lord of the Moon), which may or may not be a reference to a Siva temple because the town itself was known by that name.
The Chaulukya (Solanki) king Mularaja possibly built the first temple at the site sometime before 997 CE, even though some historians believe that he may have renovated a smaller earlier temple.

In 1024, during the reign of Bhima I, the prominent Turkic ruler Mahmud of Ghazni raided Gujarat, plundering the Somnath temple and breaking its jyotirlinga. 
He took away a booty of 20 million dinars.
Historians expect the damage to the temple by Mahmud to have been minimal because there are records of pilgrimages to the temple in 1038, which make no mention of any damage to the temple.However, powerful legends with intricate detail developed in the Turko-Persian literature regarding Mahmud's raid,which "electrified" the Muslim world according to scholar Meenakshi Jain.
They later boasted that Mahmud had killed 50,000 devotees. 
The devotees had tried to defend the temple from being vandalised and looted.<center>

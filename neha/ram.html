Nadu, India. It is also one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. It is one of the 274 Paadal Petra Sthalams, 
where the three of the most revered Nayanars (Saivite saints), Appar, Sundarar and Tirugnana Sambandar, have 
glorified the temple with their songs. The temple was expanded during the 12th century by Pandya Dynasty, and its 
principal shrines sanctum were renovated by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan and his successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan of the Jaffna kingdom. 
The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India.The temple is located in Rameswaram 
considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Smarthas. The presiding deity, the 
Lingam of Ramanathaswamy (Shiva), is believed to have been established and worshiped by Rama, an avatar of the 
god Vishnu, to absolve the sins created during the Ramayana war at Sri Lanka.
<p>According to the Ramayana, Rama, the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, prayed to the god 
Shiva to absolve him of the sin of killing a Brahmin, committed during his war against the 
demon king Ravana in Sri Lanka.Rama wanted to have a large lingam to worship Shiva. 
He directed Hanuman, the monkey lieutenant in his army, to bring a lingam from the Himalayas. 
When Hanuman was delayed in bringing the lingam, Sita, the wife of Rama, built a small lingam out of the sand
available in the sea shore, which is believed to be the lingam in the sanctum</p>

Kedarnath Mandir (Kedarnath Temple) is a Hindu temple dedicated to 
Lord Shiva. It is on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the 
Mandakini river in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand in India. Due to extreme weather
 conditions, the temple is open only between the end of April (Akshaya Tritriya) to 
November (Kartik Purnima - the autumn full moon). During the winters, the 
vigrahas (deities) from Kedarnath temple are brought to Ukhimath and 
worshipped there for six months. Lord Shiva is worshipped as Kedarnath, 
the 'Lord of Kedar Khand', the historical name of the region.<p>
The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be 
reached by a 18 kilometres (11 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. 
Pony and manchan service is available to reach the structure. 
The temple was built by Pandavas and revived by Adi 
Sankaracharya and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, 
the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva. It is one of the 275 
Paadal Petra Sthalams, expounded in Tevaram. Pandavas were 
supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.
 The temple is one of the four major sites in India's 
Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas. 
This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas</p>
<p>Kedarnath was the worst 
affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. 
The temple complex, surrounding areas and Kedarnath town suffered extensive. 
damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any "major" damage, apart from a 
few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing 
debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a 
barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding pr
emises and other buildings in market area were heavily damaged</p>

<br>Popularly-narrated legend holds that subsequent to the Kurukshetra war of the epic Mahabharata, the Pandavas on the advice of the god Krishna and other sages wished to atone for their sins of fratricide and Brahmanahatya, committed by them during the war by seeking pardon from the god Shiva and also pray for his blessings before attaining salvation. But Shiva was not willing to meet them since he was annoyed with them for the unjust events of the war. He, therefore, avoided meeting them at Kashi and went incognito as the bull Nandi to Guptakashi. But Pandavas pursued him to Guptakashi and recognized him in the disguised form of Nandi. When Bhima, the second Pandava brother tried to hold the bull by its tail and hind legs, Nandi vanished from Guptakashi, into the ground (into a cave for hiding), but reappeared later as Shiva in five different forms namely, hump at Kedarnath, face at Rudranath, arms at Tungnath, 
navel and stomach at Madhyamaheshwar and the locks at Kalpeshwar.
<p>A triangular shaped rock is worshiped in Garbhagriha of the temple. Surrounding Kedarnath, there are many symbols of the Pandavas. 
Raja Pandu died at Pandukeshwar. The tribals here perform a dance called "Pandav Nritya".The mountain top where the Pandavas went to Swarga, is known as "Swargarohini", which is located off Badrinath. When Darmaraja was leaving for Swarga, one of his fingers fell on the earth. At that place, Dharmaraj installed a Shiva Linga, which is the size of the thumb. To gain Mashisharupa, Shankara and Bheema fought with maces. Bheema was struck with remorse. He started to massage Lord Shankara’s body with ghee. In memory of this event, even today, this triangular Shiva JyotirLinga is massaged with ghee. Water and Bel leaves are used for worship.
When Nara-Narayan went to Badrika village and started the worship of Parthiva, Shiva appeared before them. Nara-Narayan wished that, for the welfare of the humanity, Shiva should remain there in his original form. Granting their wish, in the snow-clad Himalayas, in a place called Kedar, Mahesha himself stayed there as a Jyoti. Here, He is known as Kedareshwara.</p>
